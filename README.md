# Measuring Outcome

**Hi Scrum Facilitators!**

Welcome to the Measuring Outcome wiki.

This game is based on Evidence-Based Management (EBM). EBM is an empirical framework which organizations can use to help measure the (perceived) product value and the way they deliver their product(s). The measurements can be inspected to help maximize product value and improve the way of working.

## The KVMs are not set in stone

Keep in mind that the KVMs are not set in stone. These are measures suggested from the EBM framework. During the game, you‚Äôll have opportunities to reflect on these KVMs, discuss and come up with new valuable KVMs yourself.

## To make your life easier

To make life easier, we‚Äôve included a manual on how to facilitate this exercise and a Cheat Sheet where all the Key Value Measures (KVMs) are explained so relax... Now you can focus totally on the exercise as a facilitator.

As of NOW we also have included a [Miro template](https://github.com/ScrumFacilitators/measuringoutcome-en/blob/develop/Measuring%20Outcome%20%5BMiro%20Template%5D%20m1.rtb) in the package, to facilitate the game virtually. Big thanks to Thijs Loggen & Jasper Alblas for creating and shaping it. The Miro game content M1 is identical to the V2 cardset.

## Releases

Use the **Release** to get the most stable and updated version of the Measuring Outcome Exercise. We‚Äôll promise to keep it updated ;-)

## Printing advice
We work closely with a professional printer who advises us on materials, development for print and owns the physical store for these products (find links to order physical products through the main Scrumfacilitators.nl website). If you want to self-print this exercise to facilitate it, the following information may be of use.
Intended card size: A5. For the game, you could get away with A6 but the instructions and cheat sheet will get hard to read.
If you want your version printed to match the store quality, ask for 400 gr mc wood-free paper and rounded corners of 6mm (rounded corners up to 10mm should still work with our designs).
